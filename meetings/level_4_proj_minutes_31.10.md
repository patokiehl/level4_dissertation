## Rough thoughts / Notes before meeting 
# Content 

## People, Location and Time 


## Progress leading up to the meeting 
- use the [[galvanic skin response (GSR)]] device is -> **GSR kit** 
- **what will the people be doing** what will the thing that the people be doing? 
- can we put the electrodes on the thing 
- *find a standard thing that changes galvanic skin response* -> **experiment**
	- generate a change in skin conductivity downstairs 
	- see what difference this makes 
	- set to the same perceived level each time 

- what task are they going to do
- how each of those steps are gong to work 
- talk to paddy and matthew 
- make sure that we cover all bases 
- how much dymaic range do we have 
	- does it stay the same or does it change 

**Experiment**
- come in 
- initial measurement 
- calibrate -> how can we avoid recalibrating every time for each person 
- do a task 
	- buttons on a steering wheel 
	- see Arrons 
	- having it on a mouse 
	- putting it on a VR controller 
		- bend them around the finger tips 
	- 
- 
**Look in the literature about galvanic skin response**
 - protocol for increasing it 
- how different people respond to GSR Stimulation 
- where do you measure it from -> does it change between people 
- test on students, split between men and women 

- **Using Galvanic Skin Response to dynamically change Amplitude when using Electrotactile feedback** -> replace vibrations 

- **can i get it on a glove** 
### Shauns notes 
- hard to test both at the same time 
- would have to test windows, and then try to map both of them 
- does Stephen have access to paddys ethics checklist?? 
- 
## Objectives agreed 
- manhiem multi component stress test 
- simple way of changing stress 
- stroop test 
- sweatiness last longer 
- can we get a lot of points with more conductivity
- **how does skin conductivity changes** 
- make a better model 
- **on a mouse** -> more than 1 thing 
	- very clear place where they are going to be
- **back of a watch** - Yusuf 


- **how are we going to calibrate**
	- after each stress exercise 
	- look for new values 
	-
