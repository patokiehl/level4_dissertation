# Overview 

## what needs to be included
- Time and date of meeting and who was present.
- Progress made in the week leading up to the meeting.
- Issues that were discussed in the meeting and any potential solutions that were identified.
- The objectives that were agreed for the coming week.

## Rough thoughts / Notes before meeting 

### Notes from Last Meeting 
- leading sentiment in the research is that people still like vibrotactile rather than electrotactile 
- could I run a longer term experiment? repeating after a while - **discussed**
	- devise a test where people would use the system for a prolonged period of time? 
	- people tend to get more used to things the longer they use them 


#### Medical papers - not discussed 
- **Medical**
	- Electrodermal is electrical activity in the skin 
		- skin impedance and skin potential 
		- Women more sensitive than men 
	- EIS -> electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
	- *Constant-Current electotactile Stimulation*
		- works on finger tips 
		- published 2022 
		- Mathematical Model 
	- The Relationship between Energy, Phase Charge, Impedance, and Perceived Sensation in Electrotactile Stimulation - Boyd, ahktar 
		-  **Problem Overview**:
			- Variability in the perceived sensation during electrotactile stimulation is primarily due to changes in the impedance of the electrode-skin interface, caused by physiological (e.g., sweat) or mechanical disturbances.
			- The goal is to establish a clearer relationship between impedance and key stimulation parameters (current, pulse duration) to minimize sensation variability.
			- -**Linear Relationships**: The study shows strong linear relationships between impedance (peak resistance, RpR_pRp​) and both peak pulse energy (EpE_pEp​) and phase charge (QQQ) at a constant sensation level.
			- These relationships hold across different subjects, electrode sizes, and locations, with an average R2R^2R2 value of 0.957 for EpE_pEp​ vs. RpR_pRp​ and 0.960 for QQQ vs. RpR_pRp​, indicating a near-perfect fit.
			- The study also confirms that the product of current squared and pulse duration (I2TI^2TI2T) is constant for a constant sensation, supporting prior findings from earlier research.

#### Electrotactile worn in the world 
- **directions** - 
- Itching -> used copper wires for this, im kind of interested in this regard 
	- found that it produced a very high reaction rate, 
	- some people also said that it was gentle **Could this be used for massage / sleep therapy** - Used in pysical Therapy - **TENS** 
- Non palmar skin sites 
- **TactileWear - stanke** -> really good paper 
	- used on watches + rings 
	- 

# Content 

## People, Location and Time 

## Progress leading up to the meeting 
- managed to get a semi python script working 
- have been very busy with other subjects so havent had a lot of time to work on this 

## Objectives agreed 
- skin conductance 
- use the [[galvanic skin response (GSR)]] device is -> **GSR kit** 
- talk to the guy in engineering 
	- impedance measuring 
	- 
- **what will the people be doing** what will the thing that the people be doing? 
- can we put the electrodes on the thing 
- *find a standard thing that changes galvanic skin response* -> **experiment**
	- generate a change in skin conductivity downstairs 
	- see what difference this makes 
	- set to the same perceived level each time 

- what task are they going to do
- how each of those steps are gong to work 
- talk to paddy and matthew 
- make sure that we cover all bases 
- how much dymaic range do we have 
	- does it stay the same or does it change 

**Experiment**
- come in 
- initial measurement 
- calibrate -> how can we avoid recalibrating every time for each person 
- do a task 
	- buttons on a steering wheel 
	- see Arrons 
	- having it on a mouse 
	- putting it on a VR controller 
		- bend them around the finger tips 
	- 
- 
**Look in the literature about galvanic skin reponse**
 - protocol for increasing it 
- how different people respond to GSR Stimulation 
- where do you measure it from -> does it change between people 
- test on students, split between men and women
