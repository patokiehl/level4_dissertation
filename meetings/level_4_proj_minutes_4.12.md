## what needs to be included
- Time and date of meeting and who was present.
- Progress made in the week leading up to the meeting.
- Issues that were discussed in the meeting and any potential solutions that were identified.

## People, Location and Time 

## Progress leading up to the meeting 
- **manhiem multi component stress test** 
- **Hear rate** 
- simple way of changing stress 
- stroop test 
- sweatiness last longer 
- can we get a lot of points with more conductivity
- **how does skin conductivity changes** 
- make a better model 
- **on a mouse** -> more than 1 thing 
	- very clear place where they are going to be
- **back of a watch** - Yusuf 


- **how are we going to calibrate**
	- after each stress exercise 
	- look for new values 

### what are we trying to determine 
- does an increase in stress / GRS (or reduction in skin impedence), mean that we have to adjust electrotactile feedback to keep it within acceptable bounds 
- **acceptable bounds**
	- min bound -> what is the minimum amplitude where a user can "feel" the electrotactile feedback 
	- max bound -> what is the maximum amplitude where the user does not experience pain and/or neuromuscular reaction 
- *is there a way to create a formula / equation to map the increase in GSR to the reduction in amplitude* 
### How to measure base case 
- what is their current GSR 
- what is their current heart rate 
- Resting thresholds for **minimum perceivable** and **maximum tolerable** electrotactile amplitudes.
### What we are measuring 
- **how does skin conductivity changes** 
- users heart rate -> to aid as another factor to see if the GSR is similar 
- Record real-time GSR and HR during stress induction tasks.
- Measure electrotactile thresholds under stress conditions to see if changes in GSR impact the perceived and tolerable bounds.
### Ways to increase stress / GSR / EDA
- **manhiem multi component stress test** 
- **stroop test** 
- **jumping jacks** 
- **Heart rate** 

### How to measure 
- sampling on the GRS -> quantitaive 
- heart rate measurements - Quantitaive -> **remember to wipe down the contacts after each user**
- talk to the user about their feedback, if we 

## Blockers 
- actually get round to setting up the bitalino 
	- how does it work 
	- does the bitalino have a heart rate monitor 
- 

## Stephens notes 
- ethics checklists are different from reserach projects 
- the eletroctactile has been used in 3 other student projects 
- contact a relaxing step to get everonye ot a relaxed state 
	- see if we can reduced level of 

- keep everything in the same location 
- static bike - Bike on the turbo 
- moderate phyiscla activity for 2mins 
	- just to stimulate a change to see what happens 
- do seomthing with the tactile feedback 
	- see arron, yousef 
- **How can we use that in practice**
	- we need a short task to see how it works 
	- how does the users feedback 
- **procedure**
	- what relaxation do i use 
- **potential for a follow up task**
	- max out on the static bike 
	- buliding something a little more complex -> make sure that i have enough to talk about in the implementation 
- 
## Objectives agreed 
- emailed paddy 
- **email Matthew** -> need to have an experiment design done as well as ethics checklist 
- try and get a pilot test planned + approved for December
- see what data i am going to get 
	- **how can i format the data**
- Stephen wants to be able to complete a pilot test before christmas
