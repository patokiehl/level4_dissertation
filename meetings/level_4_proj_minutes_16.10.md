## my thoughts 
- leading sentiment in the research is that people still like vibrotactile rather than electrotactile 
- could I run a longer term experiment? repeating after a while 
- devise a test where people would use the system for a prolonged period of time? 
- people tend to get more used to things the longer they use them 

**Problems with electrotactile**
 - a lot of people find the area not localised 

- **people like watches**
	- vibration motors tend to make a sound 
	- how can we replace this with electrotactile 
	- this will take time as people will need to learn it 

**Navigation** - specifically with audio only, ie no screen to look at
 - consistent low pulse to let you know that you are on the correct path 
 - increase in amplitude when you are coming up to a junction 
 - combine with audio 
 - most tested speeds ~ 10kph 
 - how can i raise it up to 16-32kph 
 - 
**Talk to paddy about gaps in literature**
- a lot of research done on using electrotactile in short 1 off experiments, no long term stuff 
- a lot of research done on the bands that people can use, this is important as there is a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes
- Glasgow uni seems to have done a lot on palmar electrotactile, how can I do non palmar 
- A little *medical* research done on how skin conductivity changes with sweat (workout / stress), not seemed to find a paper that covers this in an electrotactile sense (spent < 1hour tho) 
- 

**Using electrotactile not placed on skin**
 - where might you put an electrode on a thing where people might use it? 
	 - steering wheel 
		 - electrodes on right and left, let the driver know if there is a cyclist coming up a side -> **this could also be placed on door handles**
		 - 
	 - back of phone -> **done a lot** 
	 - 
## 16/10 minutes 

### Progress made 
- retrieved the electrodes + devices from Paddy 
- managed to get it working on my windows 10 PC at my parents house
- 
### issues discussed 
- spent about 4 hours trying to get it to work with my laptop 
- not managing this yet 

- Do i try to make a product that is hard to learn but once you learn it is performs better or should i be trying to make a product that is very easy to learn quickly 

### Research conducted so far 
- **directions** - 
- Itching -> used copper wires for this, im kind of interested in this regard 
	- found that it produced a very high reaction rate, 
	- some people also said that it was gentle **Could this be used for massage / sleep therapy** - Used in pysical Therapy - **TENS** 
- Non palmar skin sites 
- **TactileWear - stanke** -> really good paper 
	- used on watches + rings 
	- 

- **Medical**
	- Electrodermal is electrical activity in the skin 
		- skin impedance and skin potential 
		- Women more sensitive than men 
	- EIS -> electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
	- *Constant-Current electotactile Stimulation*
		- works on finger tips 
		- published 2022 
		- Mathematical Model 
		- 

### Objectives agreed 
- Need to do a lot of practical messing about with my mircrobit and the devices, 
- **What is my research Question** ???? 
- 

- measure the skin, when we do the simulation 
	- impendence measuring devices 
	- galvanic skin devices 
- **get a base line measurement of the skin conductivity, when we do the stimulation** 
	- **how does it change -> how can we change the stimulation to feel the same** 

- How can we put electrodes on things 
	- how can we make 
- **Using electrotactile in the real world** 

- door handle 
	- using thermal feedback 
- **Specific use cases?**
- 
# Notes in Meeting 
 - need to conduct an ethics checklist 
 - Speak to Matthew Chalmer 

### Where do we use vibrations in the real world 

### Putting the electrodes on the thing rather than the person 


### Nour 
 - riding on a beam 
 - danny macaskill ridge challenge 
 - spotting traffic 
 - Josh Wood -> what would you help to teach people 

#### what makes gaming fun 
- repeated stimulation 
- makes failing fun, 
- easier to spend more time on
- you get constant feedback, positive reward loop 

#### what you can help 
 - balance - lot of people struggle with balence 
 - track stands -> how can you make people 

#### pothole 
- how can people dodge potholes 
- how can people spot potholes 
- **how can we make people better at cycling on roads**
- how can we make people more confident 
- see the DVLA hazard perception test 

#### close passes 
- how can we make people able to handle close passes better 
- can we simulate a close pass when on the bike 


### Thomas 
- what is the build process 
- what steps need to be done first, 
- how can we know when someone is on a step, how can we prevent them from making mistakes? and avoid jumping ahead 

#### car mechanics 
- see watching a YT video, talking about electrical systems 
	- dont pull this wire out, if you have pulled it out, dont put it back in
